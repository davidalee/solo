Yo, On and on and my nuts I'm palming,
Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain heart is to charmin'
Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit pop your bottles toast to screen cheers!
Get you 2-step 'cause it's the record of the year
Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair,
Officially announcing that this is warfare
'cause back in the day my clouds was grey
And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse that cut the NSX
But I was still ridin' in them thin ass jets,
But now,

My business' so clear out the window of the leer
And I'm talking on my celly all this shit that you should hear,
Listen clearly now,
Hello, can you hear me now?

Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

So, drop your purse, and grab your hips,
And act like you're tryin' to get this money right quick,
So can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

On and on and this beat is zoning,
I control the mind straight over the phone,
Let 'em explore the words something like a tourist,
They never get addicted unless...
From Louisdales to Jimmy Choos is real,
She knows the time she sees the Richard Mille,
Flat double skeletal tourbillon
It's just like her body move it turns her on,
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers,
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See I can do it this away I can do it that away
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway
So cool like new edition that she hollas your scent,
I'll get it OK, let it boil away,
But please run along, 'cause lady is feeling wrong,
And I got some right for 'em right after this song
'cause my name is Skate-Board-P

Ladies and gentlemen,

Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

So, drop your purse, and grab your hips,
And act like you're tryin' to get this money right quick,
So can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

On and on and the temperatures warming
I spit heat flashes, niggas get nautious,
Bright as a bitch
So analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit
Should I mention the fact the transition is the track
No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at
No skateboy P too grown
Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone
It's so cold you don't wanna feel the chill of it (Uh!)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it (Uh!)
I don't smoke but I bet the... love it!
Totally intensifies the vivid ass appeal of it

You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,
But all these little niggas got something in reach
So... you want me, these niggers did funny
While on my boat party trying to sun seek,

Mearle maire, club muchacho
Asorted flavours, in they solatos
Inspire young minds, stacked by Nato's
With the right determination of a patho
Running 'cross the water with bricks at his poncho
Face like a shoot when it's bussin' my glock hold
Vanity stings, 'til I die when the holy father hands me my wings
When I was young yo the teacher gave me stanity dreams
Giving me music like drugs and they handed me things, they shoot it up
See me on the TV, the cuties they wanna fuck
Both presidental and plus, they hoop it up
Got more hits in his zip, who want enough
I can go back in time, you be Judge Eato
With my men and ?? I know you thinkin' Neato
Givin' peace to minutes, something like your T-Vo
But it's 3 hundred thousand more with no remote
Take it in the rain, I used to live with Tito
But he clowned me and told me that my money's free-doughs
Now the Enzo doors go up like a Dilo
Reon, same song some from my man Nigo
SLR, when the doors go up it's like a fresh elle jar
Nigga we boss, he shall not get hot, he too frost
Yessur...

[Bridge] 
My nigga close your eyes,
Just picture you're self just holdin' pies
Impliment a plan and and you'll surely rise
Just promised by the man that controls the skies
Don't you see, I know that shit's so ill
Better yet, dawg, just tell me how you feel
...How you feel dawg?

[Chorus]
We just picture thinking, dreaming, scheming, breathing, reading, all in the late night
Shaking, boiling, lacing, bacon, shaking, shaping, gotta get this cake right
As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight
...My nigga how does it feel?
Ha ha! Yessur!

[Verse 2]
Nigga you don't know me
I'm part Howard Hues, part horny, part holy
First trip on the ramp is the rock and rolly
Keep one on my staff with a new pro-chromy
If they priest need the mention that I've been biten
But a force be the chocolate where critics are written
He dresses insane where his music admire
Ask anyone from Vouge and Esquire And Vanity Fair you like can of the year
But you should guess who's in insanity chair 
Now it ain't about what I want 
Still thumbing through my life like a drug-star porn
It's one thing to say you did it
It's one thing to lie about your didgits
It's one thing to say that you live it
It's another for you fuckers to admit it
But I admit I got all this paper plus the prettiest faces that's off of our nature 
I drive a Casper, s'cuse me Cassper, wanted meet me at my house, I got space like NASA
And it'll make me happy buy yourself a Sattle
Unlike my sister Stacy when she lost her papa
I been there, gettin stroke and nothing to trap-uh 
John could do, when surrounded with true
A man dies, baby born, as far as Peru
It's a simple proof between us and imposters
We hop in the air, and don't care what it costs us
Now I'm with NERD with a pit full of Martians
I guess you could say that we fly like saucers
Zapping at niggas, with classing and figure
The cash and class whippers
The thrashing mag ripper
Go 'head and say it (you a rappin' ass nigga)
Yessur!

Ma the way you huggin on me is a problem what the fuck you tryin' to end up in the gossip column 
I know I got jewels like im the pharroah of the ghetto 
but we are in the bright ass shiny carrara 
stickin your feet out the window so they can see your stillettos 
costs a thousand dollahs same as your house n holla 
not to mention your wrists and the thirty thousand collah 
pussy must be good he's victim to your power....shit 
nigga like me I would never avower 
spit that shit to me i'd ask you haveyou showered 
you wanna get up in my boat and ride 
take pictues of with the kid up in ocean drive 
go to casatua and sip on calluas at the bar talking to other women about the best jewelers 
you would like that huh... 
smile and still call your girlfriend (why) 
who fell asleep at the wheel 

certainly the crassest 
the restuarants classes 
the owners is ass 
my money is green like the helmet of a fashess 
so what you want patrone no patrussi in glasses 
aint no mystery his daughter knows the history 
and every night we toast like its victory get with me 
and i aint change sense my early intel 
ive been snackin on shrimp and sippin on shirrley temples 
no drug to drinkin what you want 
no seriously what you thinkin sense the yukon 
never puffed a jay you ask lou shaun 
back when he pushed babes like it was like coupons 
with a house full of dames like it was moulon 
i would ask there name but they would only do shaun 
and i aint sayin they regret it but fuck would they do but if they could reverse time what the fuck would they 

Yeah, ye...spit my gum out right now...haha
What up world? Got my inspiration in the studio with me, right?...feelin' good
Got a lot to smile about, ahaha, talk to y'all niggas...yessur, hey

[Verse 1]
My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fucking therapist
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody else's carelessness...
[cork pops] There goes the top, nigga, so here it is
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets
Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceit
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap
She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted
Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums
Look, oo you see me ma
They wish they could be me ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
Cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th
I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under
Cause 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer

[Chorus]
My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what).
See, you wont even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it
out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out

[Verse 2]
Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed
That's Atlantis appartments, we live in half the back
That's where the 12 year olds there, they be flashing crack
And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back
Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped cause I chased, what made me passion that
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many niggas will rise
So many them niggas try
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied
So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride
Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive
Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive
Divine intervention this is
I heard a voice nigga, listen to this

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Jesus will arrange it, but Jesus wont change it
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it
You mad, nigga don't articulate in Sanskrit,
I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless
Can't be mad at the world cause you and your girl ain't famous
Cause you both on bate, BBC and chainless
Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless
Now you brainless, dangerous, cause you pull out the stainless
All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous
No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop
Nigga rewind and reverse slides 3 times
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine
First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'
Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine
Now you, scrunching your face tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga
Success is taingeable, don't wait for fame
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank

Never in a million years I'll imagine I'll get my thrills
By listening to squeals of PJ wheels
As we land I duck down, I stick my head up my dick is
being sucked down, by a bitch named what now
I look in her eyes, and her eyes are like an orange stars
Look at the reflection of my foreign car by R & R
I stick my feet out, you know the bapes that's made of eel
You know the new checks with nigo face right on the heel
I was a marching band, I was a skateboader
Jesus made wine, I couldn't make water
Ox-moronic, I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders
You niggaz were cool in school now you niggaz take orders
I'm not dissin your job
But now you listen and nod
Some mount the limit shit, I know this position is odd

Don't Gasp for air
You can turn blue
Look, accel nigga
trust me you can do it

[Chorus]
You can do it too young blood
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young blood
And watch whose in your crew young blood
It don't matter if you do drugs,
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young blood
I did you can do it too

[Verse Two]
I know niggaz are like there's no returning when I
bought that white five-fifth
So white that the coke heads just might try sniff
I ordered the phatom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey
And the interior was like crack white beige
At least that's what it looked like when it was on that page
I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well
Life's a bitch but not too extreme
Life's got a fat ass, Trust me I'ma fuck full steam
I make the world cream and scream, while I'm gettin my cream
I'm coming to america call me Prince Akeem, yessir
It's kinda weird, 'cause this I dream
Kinda prophetic ya get it 'cause this I seen
These type of visions, since I's teen
I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed byzine
Laughed with the class with the slightest clue
You be buying my shit, and I be rappin to you, but you can do it too

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude
Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you
He got robbed and it seems he has a huge
He's frustrated and that it all he has is you
So, things propel and things excel
The next the a bing comes out the barrell
And my man they accused him of sittin tight up in jail
Ironic he close my man luke can hear him yell
I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat
I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back
I got a call from Virginia grandma went back
The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat
See her body went down and her soul went up
She sent angels around me so evil could not touch
I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck
Wealthy niggaz with a conscience, yeah you know what's up
The wires across, and it's breeding a plague
The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away
Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain
Up all night with the books and you read till the day
But still ya house of diddy 'cause you got a little paper
Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature
Never underestimate the-things you do
Read your verse too, inhale the "oo", and go

Mama help i fell in love with a young girl 

(thats true, so true) 
(you're the only girl i love to) 

My heart was soakin and i will be in a young world 

(so true, so true, listen) 

I wasn't tryin to lead her on 
See i didn't wanna be alone 
But when she smiles she braught me home 
So i braught her home, 
Its not that the fealin of love is gone 
Cant expect a car little girl to be grown 
I cant give a fuck what so and so says 
Crushes hurt both ways 

What on earth, what i'm suppose to do 
What on earth, what i'm suppose to do 
What on earth, what i'm suppose to do 
Somebody tell me what i'm suppose to do 

Mama help i fell in love with a young girl! 

What on earth, what i'm suppose to do 
Young girl, so in love with you 
What on earth, what i'm suppose to do 
What on earth, what i'm suppose to do 
What on earth, what i'm suppose to do 
Somebody tell me what i'm suppose to do 

My heart was soakin and i will be in a young world! 

What on earth, what i'm suppose to do 
Young 
Young girl, so in love with you 

The single girls are out tonight 
But you have one word, my heart, one life 
And i'm not lookin around 
So why you lookin down 
(what you lookin down for?) 

I fucked up a long time ago 
See i should have never let you know 
See i couldnt give a fuck what tabloids say 
(as the people magazine) 
And crushes hurt both ways 


You're that girl
[Who] thinks the world
Is somethin beautiful
And that's all baby
But your lookin for a brawn
with shed upon the wrong star
Cause it don't know
That's not how it goes
So, I can't explain, why things are made the same and others change
He made it that way
But the perplexities of world
Leaves more oysters and pearls
And I don't know
It's just the way it goes (But i know you can)

[Chorus]
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
Hide yours
Feel the bate
Hear the choice
Hear the choice
Hear the choice (Hey!)

[Verse 2 - Pharrell]
Don't take the time
To relax your mind
So unusual (ooh baby)
But your priorities are disheveled
But your emotions and your health just don't go
Your body says no, So-
I can't conceive
That leaves will grow on trees in loweth degrees
and comeback next spring
But the perplexities of life
Brings more days that bore new skies
So whose to know, possible (that you could)

Manolo pumps is tappin' and you lips stick's red
(we're just ah f*ckin, ah f*ckin)
Your Louie purse and I just think I love your hair
(we're just ah f*ckin, ah f*ckin)
Meet me in the hallways where the bathrooms are
(we're just ah f*ckin, ah f*ckin)
Can you drive a stick I wanna know can I be your car
(wooo)

[Chorus]
I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
Are you by your self tonight, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
Excuse me Im talkin to you...hey

[Verse 2]
I can imagine havin my arms around you back
(we're just ah f*ckin, ah f*ckin)
And I can imagine your heart beat pumpin' through you chess
(we're just ah f*ckin, ah f*ckin)
I hope it goes beep beep, beep beep, beep beep
beep beep, beep beep,
Excuse me Im talking' you
(hey)

[Chorus]
I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
Are you by your self tonight, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
I see that look in your eyes, I wanna touch you
(Baby)
Excuse me Im talkin to you...hey

[Nelly]
As I look through the crowd of the pupils into ya pupils
Yea boo I see you too, Damn right I wanna do you too
In ya eyes I can tell what you thinkin'
Why aint we somewhere hot for the weekend
Seafood eatin', I heard you like Red Lobster
You the type might like to sun bathe 
Jump off the yacht and jet ski the runway
I give it to you like (uhh)
Moan and scream out (baby)
Do the things that will make you say (uhh)
Damn right I spoiles my (baby)
It aint nuttin to me Im (uhh)
Million dolla boy type (baby)

Ou Father, Which art in heaven 
Im so grateful 
Of all the beautiful things 
That you are allowing me to see 
Birds, Bees 
The ability to do what I do 
The opportunities 
I know you love me now 
And i think it's time 
And my duty, to tell the world (jesus is my daddy im tellin' you, oh) 

... don't let me fall 
You watch for who im friends with 
I got tattoos, you forgive me 
You know im so sensitve 
You know im chased by women 
You know mt mind is drivin' 
To you my heart is givin'...oowww 

[Chorus]
You're the greatest 
You're the greatest (wow wow) 
you're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy im telling you) 
Your're the greatest 
Don't let me fall 

They don't understand 
What you do for me (do foe me) 
And nothing by my actions 
They don't I believe (I believe) 
Not talking 'bout what I wear 
When i drivin' where i sleep 
I mean the ability to hear, feel and sleep 

In the heart of a re-up, it's somthin' like a G up
MCA fingering that B up or that C up
Fiends creep up with their flesh lookin' beat up
And my tennis ball is stuffed with enough work to fill a tea cup

He opened up his jacket
I opened up my packet
He pulled out his money
I'm pullin' out that honey

He stuff it in his stem soon as he took it from me
Yellow teeth chaffed lips and his nose is runny
He lit that shit, he hit that quick as if I was high
I asked him where them bricks at shit

He smiled as if he was payin' homage
He said in the back of the apartment
Where they be selling ganja

But beware of the AK held by HM Thomas
Son gotta keep him high in them bottoms or some old pyjamas
I said shit ma nigga take another hit
We ran up in that crib with them Uzis and them Sigs

Give up the work or we tyin' up the kids
Did I get that work, what you think? Yes I did
I didn't actually that wasn't true and
If you aspire to hustle, that's a how to, to you

This that shit make you wanna hustle
Carry square guns shootin' metal with muffles
Trunk full of cash with a couple of duffles
So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles

We gonna show you how to hustle
(Holla back)
So you can style all these sneakers
(Holla back)

So you can style all these sneakers
(Ya follow that)
So you can style all these sneakers
(well, follow this)

It's incredible how I etch my plans out
To be physically subtle and financially stand out
You should see me stick that big S on my anso
And literally call destructure so no one can touch ya

Teenage girls'll love ya and models wanna fuck ya
Ice cream ya way on to somebody's magazine cover
So much money that the lid threatens eruption and
The bank says you don't have to call like you're Usher

And I ain't kill or sell drugs to nobody
But I know niggas that kill and stretch work like pilates
Nigga the crack house was literally right beside me
When them fiends hit that shit they kicked just like karate

We named one Bruce lie, one slim Kelly
Who issued too much quicker than Luis rank and M belly
Yeah, I escaped but there's nothing you can tell me
'Cause thought I paper chase, my memories won't fail me

This that shit make you wanna hustle
Carry square guns shootin' metal with muffles
Trunk full of cash with a couple of duffles
So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles

We gonna show you how to hustle
(Holla back)
So you can style all these sneakers
(Holla back)

So you can style all these sneakers
(Ya follow that)
So you can style all these sneakers
(Well, follow this)

In the hood, wake up to the hammer noise
Sound like the work of my jerks the swagger boys
Pull up and them eyes wide open, stack of toys
If your girl want to leave with us that's her choice

The feelin' throbbin' I got it and poppin' phenomanal
Nigga signed a million dollar cheque with his pyjamas on
Film it like a porno no need to re-word it
Nigga the enzo just came and I ain't have to jerk it

Yeah, niggas you heard it the perversion of stars
I guess if I go in my garage, it'd be a menage
Niggas can't hate on this like summer in '84
When we high off potato chips

New cript and Florida were the soul core corridors
Yes them babies mine, fuck I need to go on my reefa
Rewire my brain, aspire to attain, tell Jacob
Light on the platinum, keep the fire in the chain

Yikes I mean ice on the motherfucker gleam
I guess if my ice is fire, it leave you niggas stinged
See there's you there's me and there's between
If you remove the between, you see I achievin' you dreams

This that shit make you wanna hustle
Carry square guns shootin' metal with muffles
Trunk full of cash with a couple of duffles
So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles
