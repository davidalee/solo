Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money

[Verse 1 - Cassper Nyovest:]
I used to put the money first, y'all still do
But that hardly works cause y'all still ask for prices from
The waiters and you're hardly served
You pay once, you pay forever, that you can't reverse
That's why I ain't paid Talib for no fuckin' verse
Mutual respect over below payments
Your mind accepted marriage when money proposed slavery
I been listenin' and four quarters of y'all won't make it
I'm Africa's number one, that's a fuckin' bold statement
And I'm the most relevant
You failin' to admit that is your biggest impediment
We're not on the same level man
Your dream girl sent me nudes and I'm checkin' 'em
Underneath the table as I'm havin' dinner with the president
Man fuck the money
O tsenya tlhogo then otla ka plane
Eh sane, being broke's for makgokgorane
They love cause they know I'm bein' real to my peeps
There's niggas richer than me who still wish they were me
Wassup

[Hook:]
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money

[Verse 2 - Talib Kweli:]
Money make niggas break promises
Money turn niggas into pharmacists
Money make you drop outta colleges
But the bars that I spit through God exist
Who we be, that's who we are
Versace, Gucci, Louis Vuitton
My taste expensive as a superstar
So I take what I want like a coup d'état
From profit sharing to profiteering
Now they stop and stare cause we cop McLarens
But we not preparing for God's appearance
Too busy dominating and domineering
Our competition securin' our position
Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition
Rap niggas lie like politicians
So I gotta tell the truth, that's a smart decision
Capitalism is a cataclysm
If white collar crime is a bad decision
Then the makers who routinely crash the system
Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison
Need money to eat, need money to live
Need money to keep, need money to give
But when pursuit of the money is your only goal
Then you lose control, then you lose your soul
Dollars and cents to rob our children of their innocence
So when it's sent, we come to our nation's capital to cash the check
According to Dr. King when he saw it clear in his dream
"We built the pyramids, they built a pyramid scheme"

[Hook:]
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money


Who I be is the super MC, run up on a group of MCs
Rappin' all rudimentary, like stupid MD
Head of Valley girls full of jealousy
But I see through the envy
I be shootin' for the stars, never shootin' the breeze
When you chase what you want, you run past what you need
Hear the call of the Lord, start fallin' to your knees
And the families be immortal like the dew on the leaves
Yup, every rhyme got a reason
You need me like your mama need Jesus
Murder rap from the words that I rap
Treatin' rappers like celebrity news, got 'em leakin'
Malcolm said I may complain so the deep shit
Is spoon fed to you with the flow if you're peepin'
So wavy with the flow, got 'em seasick
Acquirin' miles, wanna know what's the secret
They all devil warship except the reverend
You keep makin' that excuse but remember this
You feel better 'bout your own failure
When you think success is based on Illuminati membership
Fuck the money, that's my new fuckin' attitude
This the Earth, wind and fire, this gratitude
Whether in paradise or ghetto avenues
I stay inspired by my longitude and latitude
Recordin' in the rainforest in Puerto Rico
Climbin' up the Dust River Falls in Ocean Rio
Joey made this beat in the Trump Tower
Fire like gunpowder, finna light it up cause the blunt's sour
Revolutionary People's Party
Evolutionary, we so godly
Still at the strip club with Nico
When he pull his hair back, we call him Nico Suave
We the people's champ like my top of the year tour
From K Valentine to jessica Care moore
Nico Is to fuckin' with Cory Mo
GQ, Rapsody to Hi-Lo
This the good ship [?], Jamla the damn squad
Colors of the color to toast in the dancehall
They call me the solution to problem I can't solve
So get off that bullshit and get on your damn job
Get on your job, nigga
Get on your job, nigga
Get on your job, nigga
Come on
We be workin' damn hard
We pullin' the damn cards like you're puttin' your hands up
We're stand up individuals
Fuck respectability, we ain't pullin' our pants up
We plugged in the lamppost, never duckin' no damn folks
We ain't bucking like Sambo's, to fuck with our damn clothes
Hoes fascinated by the fashion statement
Yet you masqueradin' as a rap crusader
I know you a hater, player
I'm concentrated on the facts and data
That-a-way I've been my favorite
'Til there's no debatin' who's the greatest rapper
Always ready for the battle, no fear factor
RIP PH, we shed a tear after hearin' that we lost a gladiator
What a real rapper
Spittin' bars in the cypher in the hereafter
I'm in artist mode
Writer then before, I'm a writer at the core
But let me get it off on stage and I prove
That I'm tighter than a moor, invite him to the war
The truth about trust is
We motivated by the rewards, no one's above this
So by that logic we're monsters in the makin'
And seekin' justice is really some persevation
You don't trust what you can't see?
You don't trust what you can't touch?
Then how do you explain love?
You don't trust what you can't see?
You don't trust what you can't touch?
Then how do you explain love?


Why all these lames wanna riff?
It's an ass-kickin' party and your name's on the list
She keep my name on her lips
Good year like my name on the blimp
I get insane off the rip
Flip, let the beef cook like the flame on the rib tip
Goin' out in a blaze with the biscuit
Got the streets hooked like the 'caine that you sniffin'
Why? Why would you ever go against it?
If I gave a fuck about you it'd be borderline offensive
It's senseless, stalkin' on my page and my mentions
Walkin' on eggs and you soundin' all defensive
Hear dogs hollerin'
That's your ego talkin' and you're listenin'
When it get to whisperin' them snakes start slitherin'
Rappin' how they're rich and all their jewelry is glistenin'
Your mortgage underwater like I walked in on a christenin'

[Hook:]
That's why, I don't fuck with these niggas, nope
I don't fuck with these niggas, nope

[Verse 2:]
I'm smoother than a criminal
I never trust niggas with no books in the livin' room
When there's no electricity, what the fuck is digital?
Beyoncé married Jigga but they think we all jiggaboos
Don't get confused by the lyric
Protector of my city, stand alone on the citadel
Wake up in the mornin', say a prayer cause I'm livin' well
Proof of a miracle, it's spiritual
These niggas go from robbin' punchlines, to bein punchlines
For lunchtime, you ain't got the heart when it's crunch time
Soldiers gettin' shot on the front line
If every soldier was brave, there'd be no word for valor
The nerve of these cowards, who are you, the herb of the hour?
I treat my girl like horiculture, I'm preservin' the flower

Say what you mean, mean what you say
You the meanest girl, you my Tina Fey
Like you out for pain, like you out for shame
But you pout when I call you out your name
Your words burnin' me, you're my bird of prey
When you feed your young, you regurgitate
What I heard you say and reverberate
But I'm a man, gotta show my vertebrae
I'm the kind to wait, you can come through with
You can run to it and get numb to it
Treat you like the Autobahn, just sung to it
Treat you like my favorite song and just jump to it
Girl you waste my bluff when we makin' love
Can't take it, love, you my favorite drug
You my fleur-de-lys, you disturb the peace
Cause you hurtin' me, you turned to me and said
Love is a potion that's fluent, let's keep it movin'
The only thing that's magic is moments, I'm only human
The only thing that's tragic is futures that we can ruin
I pound for couple of hours, double influence
Need a break from the words you're usin'
My love broke my Kevin Hart
Let me explain cause I see what you're doin'
Mama said, "You don't need to stay"
Papa said, "Boy you need to pray", goddamn


We can't internalize the things people say to us
But it make you sus, I need a break from us
I used to think your attitude was a major plus
Now the way you talk to me is like we breakin' up
Tryna get into my zone without you makin' a fuss
Like sticks and stones, your words breakin' stuff
They hittin' home, but I can take a punch
I'm your David Lynch, you're my naked lunch
I found space for us, found a place for us
Used to pray for love, used to pray for us
Would've gave you my blood but you gave it up
My heart a house for this love but you sprayed it up
You can't take a brush, comments is tangled up
In a web of emotion that's dangerous
I can't make this up, that shit is lame as fuck
I ain't a slave but I'm out here tryna make a buck
Stayin' on my hustle, I ride around and I spend it
Set it into motion like butterflies to defect it
Tryin' to pretend that the words are never effective
Seem to work for a second but never be worth the effort
I'm a man and they say I ain't s'posed to run on emotions
So I let you get away with more than you were supposed to
I kept it bottled up like a note to float in the ocean
Just stop myself, I'm explodin'


A cautionary tale
I heard about this new artist
Somebody said he was the hardest
Seem like I gotta do the knowledge
Cause I don't go by those comments
Loving the promise of some new hot shit
And apparently this kid got it
He adored by all of them bloggers
They describe him down to his boxers
I heard last night he had problems
With some other random ass nigga
Tonight the blog is on fire
Them niggas beefing on twitter
His timeline full of depression
But his death the life of the party
They celebrating his self destruction
It make for excellent copy

The life a series of moments
And VIP he be posting
Dudes be drinking that potion
Girls all in they emotion
Thorough breads in the stable, what
Pills on his table, what
I heard he staying independent
He don't fuck with major labels
The rumors keep on swirling
Every interview is a circus
Yeah he grinding, he working
But his lack of God is disturbing
Can't wait to write about how the drugs to blame
He was numbing the pain, he was loving the fame
Plus think he going out with what's her name
With an ass so fat she won't fuck with lames

Heard your baby mama got crazy drama
Get way too violent and drunk
Couldn't make an honest woman out of her
Now he face your honor every month
Now she slandering niggas on instagram
So her followers up and her kids be down
She be giving out advice how to get a man
On the sex tape part of a business plan
Now she coming out next to plug
A new song she gets on the breakfast club
Where party promoters give extra love
All the hypebeasts saying sit next to us
I heard a bunch of these rumors
I heard it made this nigga lose it
Only thing I have yet to hear
Is any of dude music


Yeah. You know. Make it work
Summer rain is like my ad-lips [?]
Right Chris?
(Sound like)
Extra precautions when they not needed
We do it like this like...

I'm still awake... in the middle of the night
Try to lay it down, try to close my eyes

[Verse 1 - Talib Kweli:]
At night I can't sleep
Cause my heart skip a beat
I can see it cause my heart on my sleeve
I can see the deceased
Tear into the flesh of the weak
Currency bear the mark of the beast
Never stand for the bull
Even when the market asleep
Anything I want is in arms reach
And the score is so sweet
But the consequence is that
I got to wear the mark of the thief
I am the man with one hand
Stranger in a foreign land
New identity cost a grand
It's the miracle worker
Serving up the offering
So make the disabled walk again
Got the melatonin, pouring in from the pineal gland
Like the blind man that saw again
Like el-Hajj Malik
Street cats fought for him
And they never ate pork again
Bear witness to the

[Hook:]
Power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
Make it clap like they're giving you a standing ovation
The adulation is such a powerful high
And as sour as my transportation
When I am heading for the clouds in the sky
Stay clean as the department of sanitation
Even though we from the gutter right
That's the power of transformation
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn [x3]
At night I can't sleep

[Verse 2 - Talib Kweli:]
At night I can't sleep

Ever you made love out in the rain
But your body so hot
That the water does not [?] in the flame
So arise to the brain [?] Profanities coming out of you
And you shouting out my name
I'm the truth like I'm coming out [?]
We are on the top of the world
And to reach this level had to climb a mountain of pain
But we are here now
Noting to fear now
Everything clear now
I ain't to tear down walls to your heart now
Every single stare down
Calling for sex
So emotional tear gonna fall
I applaud your agility
Should you really be deserving an encore standing ovation
Old faces, Got you feeling all flush
Cause we are touching in public places
In the studio [?]
Making amateurs movies in a condo
You gonna need a toe-tag like John Doe
When I'm wilding out with my tongue like Jon Snow
Every sword need a chief
Animal attraction like I'm lord of the beast
You are the lioness
And you roar so loud
Niggas call the police

You are going places
I make the temperature rise
Call it homeostasis
We are up and down
We on and on
I'm sorry ain't being around
Let me show remorse
Now you show in off
Now you show in out
Know what? We are staying in
Fuck going out

Let's go
Squadin' up and the crew is tough
Cold and frozen the chosen, like I got Jewish blood
Commit like institutions
I married to my music
Women in my life are gettin' jealous, because is my truest love
Get my eyes on the prize, cause my lyrics are like the pupils
Murdering the verses
I am Like Persus to Medusa bro
Better [?]
But angels are falling like Lucifer
How could see coming [?] this discussion is to much blood
Academic fellowship even my mellow shit is super tough
Not the fellowship of the ring [?]
I am a follower of the freestyle fellowship then niggas knew their stuff
I'm a student of [?]
Long pieces of Jupiter
But nowadays rappers are duper
Swearing to God their were blowing up
I soon I take the stage
Niggas [?] like a super cut
Immediately [?]
[?] And n- getting tough

It's not so much a business where you make a lot of money but if you enjoy the business then the money comes. But if you're looking for the fast, instant kind of famous and money it's going to be boring to you because it doesn't happen quite like that

{Yeah, yeah... [?]}

[Verse 1:]
When the money come it's sweet as a honeybun
But when the money gone they hide like a honeycomb
They tell you get your education
Nigga, go to college
They colonizing your mind like Rhodesia
What you, a Rhodes scholar?
They never tell you that degree is just a receipt
You be paying off them loans til you're 6 feet deep
Peep
In my environment every snitch gon' have to die
You ask me why
Cause my entitlement is American as apple pie
It's hard to get a check, it's easy to get in debt
Then get it wet
You could get a little head for a little bread
That shit is dead
Get by, get over
You gotta get ahead or be back in the shelter by 12 so you can get a bed
The conditions you raised in is preyin on your decision-making
You concentrating on that short paper
The broad paper, that hard candy, that jaw breaker
The dark side of the force pay for that Lord Vader

[Chorus:]
How you tell a nigga from the hood?
We on the Dirty, Sexy Money like Blair Underwood
My money good [x4]

Can't touch it
It's only human to want to look
Money talk
My shit be tellin everyone to shhh
My money good [x4]

[Verse 2:]
The millionaire musician a fairly recent phenomenon
Before there was [?] musicians performing on the street corners
Out in the deep forest
The city drop the beat, the night air sing a sweet chorus
The trees lean toward us in order to take in the CO2 that we let out and convert it into oxygen
Every time you blow a breath out you start the cycle again
Recycle the wind, spin it any way you want it
It's priceless, this life is a blessing
No matter how you slice it or dice it, you can grill it like a swordfish
A beautiful mind, the bars gorgeous
I know I'm a suspect
When I'm walking and the streets is like my office
We the working class artists
They wishin that we was porpoise
But I know my worth
Tell em to make an offer of gold first
I'm in the fight of my life and I'm taking the whole purse
Soul search
For getting paid for creating the cold verse
Got the money on my mind
Tryna escape and it don't work
Church

We sell, crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk at the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through "Epidodes II," like "Attack of the Clones"
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
To get by.. just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you eagles spread rumors
We survivalists, turned to consumers
To get by.. just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Me Abuela raised three daughters all by herself, with no help
I think about a struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words, melt in my mouth
They hot, like the jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Core bailed me out
To get by.. just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy through the red sky
with the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, "Livin' to Let Die"

[Chorus: Background singers]
This morning, I woke up
Feeling brand new and I jumped up
Feeling my highs, and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin, and stop drinkin
And I've been thinkin - I've got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)

[Talib and background singers]
(ba ba ba, ba da bada, ba da bada, ba da bada, ba da badahh
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by by by by by by)
(ba ba ba, ba da bada, ba da bada, ba da bada, ba da badahh
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by by by by by by)

[Verse 2: Talib]
We keeping it gangster say "fo shizzle", "fo sheezy" and "stayin crunk"
Its easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stay drunk
Yo, our activism attackin the system, the blacks and latins in prison
Numbers of prison they victim black in the vision
Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to
I let them know we missin you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The TV got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin to rely on, we get high on all types of drug
When, all you really need is love
To get by.. just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon, "Imagine all the people watch"
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop

[Chorus: Background singers]
This morning, I woke up
Feeling brand new and I jumped up
Feeling my high's, and my low's
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking, and stop drinking
And I've been thinking - I've got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)

[Talib: repeat 2x - with background singers]
Yoyoyo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We decieve when we lie, and we keepin it fly

Yoyoyo, yo
When, the people decide, to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin the signs
